# Cognitive-Agency-Rehabilitation-Application
A virtual reality application that is used to ehnance cognitive agency rehabilitation among patients.

# How it Works?
This application was built as a virtual gamified enviornment, which allows patients to play through various levels while training their sense of agency. The goal of the game is simple: place a cup in a coaster. However, the more levels the player completes the harder this simple task takes (i.e. the coaster size increases and the time interval to react decreases). While desigining the game, I added certain subliminal cues that ehance a users sense of agency the more they play, allowing them to have a non-invasive form of rehabilitiation.

# Features
* Hand Tracking: I integraded the Leap Motion SDK with unity to provide a more realistic and immerisive experience by mirroring the users hand movements wihtin the virtual reality enviornemnt.
* Score Tracking: There is a custom scoring mechanism that was built between scenes in Unity that adjusts the users score depending on a variety of actions.(i.e. user loses points for dropping the coster and gains points for completeing various levels)
 
 # Tech Stack
* Game Design: Unity Engine
* Moiton Tracking: Oculus SDK
* Hand Tracking: Leap Motion SDK
* Game Functionality (i.e. scoring system, integrating cognitive agency cues, and more): .NET using C#
